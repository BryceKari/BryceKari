### Hello fellow human! (or bot, no hate here)

I am a student at Iowa State University in aerospace engineering. This account is primarly to be used for a computer science course, although there may be some prjects from my hands on [Make to Inovate Team][1].
I enjoy the little free time awared to myself by playing many video games. 
The best way to contact me is through email: brkari@iastate.edu
